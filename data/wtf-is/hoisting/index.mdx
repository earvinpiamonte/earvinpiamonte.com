Probably the most common interview questions after `var` vs. `let` vs. `const`, what the fuck is _hoisting_?

JavaScript hoisting refers to the process where the interpreter appears to move **declarations** to the top of their scope before executing the code.

Take a look at the following code snippet:

```javascript
price = 420;

var price;

console.log(price);
```

By just looking at the code, these are the following steps that seems to happen:

1. assign `420` value to `price`
1. declare `price` as a variable with `var`
1. reference the variable with `console.log()`

Before the interpreter actually executes the code, the interpreter looks for all the declarations and hoists them to the top of their respective scope in memory.

Using the same snippet above, here's what happens:

```javascript
price = 420;

var price; // <- found declaration, hoisted

console.log(price); // 420
```

1. found declaration `var price`; hoisted to the top of scope
1. assign `420` value to `price`
1. execute `console.log()`

> JavaScript only hoists declarations and not initializations.

Initialization only happens until the line of code is executed.

Updating the code snippet above to the following will log `undefined`:

```javascript
console.log(price);

var price = 420;
```

The default initialization of the `var` is `undefined`.

So how does the interpreter know that `price` is a variable and it did not throw a `ReferenceError`? It means that the interpreter knows the `price` variable before it does `console.log()`. The variable declaration happened first before executing the code.

Now what will happen if we change `var` to `let` or `const`?

```javascript
console.log(price);

let price = 420; // Uncaught ReferenceError: price is not defined
```

> Variables declared with `let` and `const` are also hoisted but, unlike `var`, they are not initialized with a given value.

A common advantage of utilizing hoisting is that it allows you to use a function before you declare it in your code.

Here's an example:

```javascript
body();

function body() {
  doSomething();
  doAnotherThing();
  // ...some other code
}

function doSomething() {
  console.log('This is something');
}

function doAnotherThing() {
  console.log('This is just another thing to do');
}
```

Writing this way makes it easier to read and understand the code as you will see more of your business logic and less of the supporting functions declared below.

It's important to note that hoisting does not move the declarations to the top of their scope physically. It only happens in memory... in the JavaScript universe.

A more detailed explanation on how hoisting works for `let`, `const` and `class` can be found at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting).
