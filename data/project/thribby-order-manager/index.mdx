A CRM mobile app used by restaurant personnels to communicate with guests. This is a front-end project with [Thribby](http://thribby.com).

The scope of this project only includes front-end development using Expo. The APIs for this application was still being built by the time this project was completed.

## How it works

The project is built with Expo as the client wanted. All the screens are defined on the `App.js`. When the `userToken` updates and have a valid value, it will show all the screens for authenticated users.

For authentication, I implemented the [authentication flow](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/auth-flow/) of React Navigation.

### Code snippet

Here's a snippet of the `App.js` file that uses a context provider and React Navigation for authentication flow.

```javascript:App.js
//...

return (
  <AuthProvider value={authContext}>
    <NavigationContainer
      theme={{
        ...DefaultTheme,
        colors: {
          ...DefaultTheme.colors,
          background: colors.brandSecondary,
        },
      }}
    >
      <Stack.Navigator
        headerMode={"none"}
        screenOptions={{ animationEnabled: false }}
      >
        {state.userToken == null ? (
          <>
            <Stack.Screen name="LogInScreen" component={LogInScreen} />
            <Stack.Screen
              name="ForgotPasswordScreen"
              component={ForgotPasswordScreen}
            />
          </>
        ) : (
          <>
            <Stack.Screen
              name="DashboardScreen"
              component={DashboardScreen}
            />
            <Stack.Screen name="OrdersScreen" component={OrdersScreen} />
            <Stack.Screen name="PaymentsScreen" component={PaymentsScreen} />
            <Stack.Screen name="BookingsScreen" component={BookingsScreen} />
            <Stack.Screen name="HelpScreen" component={HelpScreen} />
            <Stack.Screen
              name="CompanyProfileScreen"
              component={CompanyProfileScreen}
            />
            <Stack.Screen
              name="AnalyticsScreen"
              component={AnalyticsScreen}
            />
          </>
        )}
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  </AuthProvider>
);

//...
```

To make sure that the application follows landscape orientation, I added the config on `app.json`.
Here's an example.

```json:app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "thribby-order-manager",
    "slug": "thribby-order-manager",
    ...
    "orientation": "landscape",
    ...
  }
}
```

## Design

I've written all the styles for each of the components. For the charts, I've used [react-native-chart-kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-chart-kit).
