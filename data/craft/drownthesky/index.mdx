Discover the universe each day with different photographs taken by stargazers.

This is an experimental project that I used to explore some of the features of Next.js framework such as `getServerSideProps()`.

Also, this is the first project that I've written in TypeScript.

Project name `drownthesky` is inspired by the song [Drown the Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rZ38L4rMT4) by William Black.
