Verify NBI clearance authenticity and validity online by entering NBI ID. Check if NBI clearance is still valid or expired. Easily share profile link. All of the NBI clearance data is fetched via NBI's unlisted API.

This project is developed and maintained by Noel Earvin Piamonte and aims to present the NBI clearance data in a different way.

This project will be archived if the NBI asks me to take it down or if they decide to restrict their unlisted API.
