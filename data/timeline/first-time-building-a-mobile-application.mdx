title: 'First time building a mobile application'
summary: 'As a senior developer, I was assigned to find a solution how we can build mobile apps. Our team has no background in mobile app development. With enough research, I decided to go with React Native. It could have been just a web app wrapped on some kind of webview but I risked to using React Native to provide a native mobile experience to users. One of the best decidions I made.'
