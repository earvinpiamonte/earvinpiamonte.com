summary: "After a few months of maintaining it, I decided to shutdown the site. It got a few users and got support from the community and has really a lot of potential to grow. But one problem though... data entry! I knew I can provide a bridge for store owners to manage their own data but I decided not to continue. Should've just sold it! hahaha."
