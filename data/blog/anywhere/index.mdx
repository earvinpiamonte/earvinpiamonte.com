Wow. You can now browse and write code on any accessible GitHub repositories on a web browser _officially_. Just visit a repo on GitHub and press the `.` (period) key on your keyboard.

The browser will open a VS Code right on the current tab with the files from the repository.

Example, visit [github.com/airbnb/javascript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) repository:

1. Press `.`
2. VS Code fires up on the browser
3. You can then browse and write code on the repository

What happens is that the original GitHub repo URL redirects to [github.dev](https://github.dev). Here's a list of some of the HTTP requests for the geeks.

From the example, [github.com/airbnb/javascript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) redirects to [github.dev/airbnb/javascript](https://github.dev/airbnb/javascript) after pressing `.` on the keyboard.

This means you can just replace `.com` with `.dev` and you can instantly load a project on VS Code on the web browser. It loads on mobile browsers too!

<div className="mb-8">

    width="300"
    height="650"
    draggable="false"
    className="rounded-md"
  />
</div>

One thing to note is that **you must be signed in** to GitHub to open a repo on VS Code directly on the browser. If not signed in, pressing `.` will do nothing and accessing directly the `.dev` URL shows up the sign in page of GitHub (at least at this time of writing).

I also said _"officially"_ because you can also browse GitHub repo files on a VS Code-like web app [GitHub1s](https://github1s.com/).
