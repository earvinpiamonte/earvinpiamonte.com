I recenly asked someone...

He answered "no".

In Javascript, if you define an object with `const`, you will still be able update its properties.

Let's you intend to have an enum of form states.

In code, you will probably write:

```javascript
const FormStates = {
  LOADING: 'loading',
  SUCCESS: 'success',
  ERROR: 'error',
};
```

Writing in `const` only means you prevent re-assignment. So the `FormStates` on the example cannot be reassigned to let's say `FormStates = ['loading', 'success', 'error']`. It will throw an error `Assignment to constant variable.`. But its properties can still be changed.

```javascript
FormStates.ERROR = 0;
```

or...

```javascript
FormStates.COMPLETE = 'complete';

FormStates; // { LOADING: 'loading', SUCCESS: 'success', ERROR: 0, COMPLETE: 'complete' }
```

So if your intention is to actually have identifiers that behave as constant and prevent new properties from being added or updated, use `Object.freeze()`.

```javascript
const FormStates = {
  LOADING: 'loading',
  SUCCESS: 'success',
  ERROR: 'error',
};

Object.freeze(FormStates);

FormStates.ERROR = 0;
FormStates.COMPLETE = 'complete';

FormStates; // { LOADING: 'loading', SUCCESS: 'success', ERROR: 'error' }
```

The `Object.freeze()` method freezes an object. A frozen object can no longer be changed. More details at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze).

> "`freeze()` returns the same object that was passed in."

So the example can also be written as follows and still get the same result.

```javascript
const FormStates = Object.freeze({
  LOADING: 'loading',
  SUCCESS: 'success',
  ERROR: 'error',
});

FormStates; // { LOADING: 'loading', SUCCESS: 'success', ERROR: 'error' }
```
