Let's say you want to run some JavaScript code outside your codebase. So you head to Google quickly and type "test javascript online" or "run javascript online".

You click on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_editor.asp) or [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) to play a few lines of code and check the result on a `console.log()` or an `alert()` or... display the result on HTML. That takes so much time.

OMG I was guilty as f.

Until I installed Node.js. And then whenever I want to test JS codes, I create a new JS file, `test.js` for example, and run `node test.js` to see the result from a `console.log()`.

Or quicker, I just type `node` on a terminal and write the expression I need to see the result.

Still, not that efficient because I have to go outside my editor.

But not until I discovered Quokka.js. It's an editor extension tool that let's you test JavaScript quickly. Productivity++ hehehe.

The code runs immediately as you type so you don't actually have to save it. The results and error messages display right next inline to the code/ identifier. Pretty cool!

Sometimes, JavaScript just don't work the way I wanted it so I needed an isolated space to test. With Quokka.js, I don't have to leave my editor anymore.

Check all the features and supported code editors at [Quokka](https://quokkajs.com/).

Test quick. Hmm, for a million days.
