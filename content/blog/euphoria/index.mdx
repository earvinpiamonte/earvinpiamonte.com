It always feels euphoric when I can write a block of code to a single line.

Take for example the following code:

```javascript
if (confirm) {
  saveUserSelection();
}
```

Nothing fancy. It's just an `if` statement that calls a function when the value of `confirm` is truthy. This snippet is probably common in handling user action in confirm dialogs.

The code can be written in one line as follows:

`if (confirm) { saveUserSelection(); }`

Just kidding hehe...

Ta-da!

```javascript
confirm && saveUserSelection();
```

This is called "[short-circuit evaluation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND#short-circuit_evaluation)". With short-circuit evalutation, the right side expression of the AND operator is evaluated _only if_ the left side is truthy. Otherwise, it just returns the left side expression.

I really like this approach for it takes less effort in reading and writing. Not writing an `if` statement means that I can save extra spaces, indentation and characters such as `{`, `}`, `(` and `)`. And saving characters means that I will only have to read minimal code and still be able to understand what the code is for.

This was once a topic on our team code review and I thought it might be good to write about it.

It might take some time to get used to this approach, especially in working on a team. But you'll get a hang of it by using it more often.

Another example could be:

```javascript
loggedInUser && showProfileScreen() && updateUserAvatar();
```

Aight...
