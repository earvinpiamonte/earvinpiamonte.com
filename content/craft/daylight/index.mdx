daylight is a Google Chrome browser extension that let's you write down notes directly on the new tab page.

## Features

- Opt in to automatically reset your notes (resets at midnight)
- Easily copy your notes of the day with a copy to clipboard button and send it anywhere
- Download current notes as text file
- Dark mode

## Notes template

You may use these available "variables" to the `Notes template` of your Settings.

Available variables:

- `[current_date]` - sets the current date
- `[current_time]` - sets the current time

These variables are automatically set on the first start of your Google Chrome browser on the day.
