> Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

Let's say we have a `Header`, `Section`, and `Footer` component and we want to add them on a `Page` component. But we also want them be the immediate children.

The DOM we want to achieve for this example would look someting like this:

```html {2-4}
<body class="bg-gray-300">
  <header>...</header>
  <section>...</section>
  <footer>...</footer>
</body>
```

Now with React, JSX, the following code will throw an error:

```jsx {3-5}
const Page = () => {
  return (
    <Header />
    <Section />
    <Footer /> // JSX expressions must have one parent element.
  );
};
```

> JSX expressions must have one parent element.

To fix this, following what we want to achieve, we can use a fragment by wrapping the children with `<React.Fragment>`:

```jsx {3, 7}
const Page = () => {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <Header />
      <Section />
      <Footer />
    </React.Fragment>
  );
};
```

`Fragment` serves as the parent element without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

Using the JSX short syntax:

```jsx {3, 7}
const Page = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <Section />
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
};
```

> Note: Empty element `<></>` cannot have keys or attributes.

Now, if we are dealing with a list for example, we may need to add a `key` attribute. For this case, we need to use `<React.Fragment>` and not the short syntax.

Here's an example from [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html):

```jsx {6, 9}
function Glossary(props) {
  return (
    <dl>
      {props.items.map((item) => (
        // Without the `key`, React will fire a key warning
        <React.Fragment key={item.id}>
          <dt>{item.term}</dt>
          <dd>{item.description}</dd>
        </React.Fragment>
      ))}
    </dl>
  );
}
```
