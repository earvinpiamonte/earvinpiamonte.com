A website that checks a domain's SSL certificate details, IP address and DNS servers.

## How it works

A user enters a domain on the site and the domain is queried to the database to check if it has already been checked previously.

If the domain has already been checked previously, it will return the results from the database, if not, it will fetch the latest SSL information.

Fetching new SSL information can also be done manually by adding `fresh` on the request. Cleaning up the results on the database was not part of this project.

### Code snippet

```php:SSLCheck.php->check()
<?php
public function check(Request $request)
{
    $domain = $request->input('domain');
    $fresh  = $request->input('fresh');

    $this->validate($request, [
        'domain' => ['required', 'regex:/^(?!:\/\/)(?=.{1,255}$)((.{1,63}\.){1,127}(?![0-9]*$)[a-z0-9-]+\.?)$/i']
    ]);

    $parse_domain_input = parse_url($domain);
    $domain             = isset($parse_domain_input['host']) ? $parse_domain_input['host'] : $domain;

    $data = $this->getDbResults($domain);

    if ($fresh) {
        $data = $this->getFreshResults($domain);
    }

    if (!$data) {
        $error = 'Could not download certificate for host.';
        $data = compact('error');
    }

    return view('sslcheck.index', $data);

}

```

## Design

The client didn't require any special design. I've used bare Bootstrap components and FontAwesome for this project.
